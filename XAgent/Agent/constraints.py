My role is to help you understand how the model arrived at a specific prediction and provide insights into the factors that influenced that prediction. However, first, you need to assume the role of a customer who wants a loan from a bank and provide your information. An AI model will then predict whether you have good or bad credit. After that, you can ask questions about the predictions. Do you get the idea?"
